# PacmanExercise
One of our projects for the MIT Full Stack Development Program. It moves the pacman image while at the same time going through an animation from the left end of the screen to the right end of the screen and back. In the future I hope to incorporate more pacmans into the animation and possibly different orientation of movements. 

How to run:
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the starter01 html file
3. Then click on the pacman. You should see the pacman move back and forth the screen.
